# Dominos Item Recommendation Dashboard


## Step 1 : Pulling the raw data from the website using Selenium

- Scraping the menu items from https://pizzaonline.dominos.co.in/
- Selecting prices for each pizza with different crusts and sizes
- _**Period of data extraction** : '2021-12-15 23:19:03'_
- _**Note** : There could be sign-in/advertisement pop up windows appearing after the date of extraction - a few callbacks using the driver maybe required then. Currently with that assumption a few lines of codes have been added to fix such issues._
